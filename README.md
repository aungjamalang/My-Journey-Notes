Welcome to my personal tech journey!  

“My personal tech journey: documenting learning, projects, and experiences in Cybersecurity, Web Dev, DevOps, and more.”

This repository contains notes, projects, and experiments across multiple topics:

- **Cybersecurity:** Bug bounty, penetration testing, labs
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel

This repo is continuously updated as I learn and explore new technologies.
